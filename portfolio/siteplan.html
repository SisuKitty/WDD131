			<h3>Color Palette</h3>

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>

			<nav>

			</nav>

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>Introduce with my name and a clear intro to my work with a motion reel. Next would lead into some of the best portfolio work, with a button to be able to look at all. Then connections to the page that tells them more details about me and finally an invite to contact me to work with me.</p>
			<h3>Portfolio</h3>
			<p>A streamlined way to look at my designs and a feature of being able to filter the work to display what the viewer is most interested in seeing. First showing it all, then can filter between motion, branding&identity, UX/UI/web, illustration, photography, etc.</p>
            <h3>About</h3>
			<p>An edited photo of myself with flourishes of art in the photo. Then an introduction to myself and my passions. Then a list of what I am good at and additional skills.</p>
            <h3>Contact</h3>
			<p>Preferred form of contact displayed first, which would be by my email. Then a option to fill out a form with a request for creating a design, with a form to wakl them through the details needed to determine if I can do that for them.</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<h3>Landing Page</h3>
			<p>
				The first thing seen will be a motion reel to show off my work dynamically. Then sections to direct to the rest of the website's contants like looking more into my portfolio and learning more about the designer. Then each page at the footer will encourage reaching out to the designer.The navigation will be automatically open but when closed, the name will shrink and the content will be centered.

			<h3>Portfolio Page</h3>
			<p>
				As you hover over the gallery of images it will display the name of the one you are hovering on along with an animation. When the image is clicked, it will bring up a window to display the details & process of the project.
			</p>
			<img src="images/Portfolio.png" alt="portfolio page wireframe" class="wireframe"/>
            <h3>About Page</h3>
			<p>
				As you scroll the sections will appear and the title image will be a fun whimsical Photoshop edited photo of the designer.
			</p>
			<img src="images/About.png" alt="about page wireframe" class="wireframe"/>
            <h3>Contant Page</h3>
			<p>
				The primary form of contact will be front and center and clicking will pull up an email, but there is then a form for sending an inquiry to the designer about any possible projects, jobs or collaborations.
